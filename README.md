# LogiSafe

**Enhancing Logistics Security and Safety with Integrated Technology**

---

## Project Overview
LogiSafe addresses major challenges faced by logistics companies, such as fuel theft, cargo delays, unsafe driving, route deviations, and suspicious activities. By integrating GPS, geofencing, biometric access, door sensors, alarms, and real-time notifications, LogiSafe ensures secure, timely, and safe delivery of goods.

## Problem Statement
Based on **SIH Problem Statement 25050** by the Government of Odisha, logistics companies face:
- Fuel and cargo theft  
- Accidents due to unsafe driving  
- Route deviations and unexpected stops in unsafe locations  
- Suspicious activities around cargo vans  
- Delays in delivery  

LogiSafe is designed to prevent these issues and provide end-to-end monitoring of shipments.

## Solution Overview
Our system integrates the following technologies:
1. **GPS** – Real-time vehicle tracking  
2. **Geofencing** – Alerts when vans deviate from the assigned route  
3. **Door Container Sensors** – Detect unauthorized access  
4. **Biometric Access Control** – Ensures only authorized drivers can operate  
5. **Alarm System** – Alerts for emergencies or security breaches  
6. **Vehicle Immobilizer** – Prevents theft by stopping the vehicle if needed  
7. **Real-Time Notifications** – Instant alerts via SMS, email, or app

## System Architecture
The system workflow:
1. Driver authenticates via biometric access  
2. GPS monitors van location  
3. Geofencing checks for route deviations  
4. Door sensors detect unauthorized access  
5. Any security breach triggers alarms and real-time alerts  
6. Vehicle immobilizer can stop the van in case of theft or emergency
